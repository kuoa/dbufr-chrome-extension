 If you are a student at Pierre and Marie Curie University, this chrome extension allows you to consult your grades, if not it just looks pretty in your browser.

This app was born from frustration, after numerous days of scrolling to get to the bottom of the DBUFR page.
It is open source so any contributions, comments, cheers, coffee cups if you see me on the campus :) are more than welcomed.

### Features
* A compact view of all your grades
* Automatic lookup of new grade updates
* Secure access to the UPMC database (using the same security protocol as the original DBUFR interface)
* Desktop and badge notifications when new grades are published
* A cool logo created by me, that has nothing to do with the extension and that uses the first 3 buttons i discovered in Inkscape.
